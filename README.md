# HouCo Flood Loss Model

R-Scripts for the development of models predicting flood losses or vulnerabilities on household content based on flood losses or vulnerabilities on building structure


## Prerequisites

As mentioned, this code is based on R-Script. Checkout * [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) for more information and to download and install the software. 

## Structure

Start the S_Master.R-script and check whether the the path to this file is also set as working directory (if not, set it). 
Check also if all the R-packages loaded by the "library" command are installed on your machine.

Now go through S_Master.R executing line after line and checkout the results. If the working directory is set correctly, the loss data should be loaded automatically and 
the R-scripts with specific analysis parts in the "Scripts" folder should be sourced.

To use your own data, make sure that you use the same data model (with the same column names) as we provided with our data or change the code accordingly.
